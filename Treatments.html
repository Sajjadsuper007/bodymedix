            <p class="mbr-text pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-7">Liposuction Surgery
<br>Liposuction surgery is one of the most common and sought after cosmetic surgery amongst all for removing fat from human body in an attempt to reshape and give a desirable figure. The number of session for removing fat from one’s body can differ from person to person depending upon the fat placement and removal technique used. Liposuction is usually done on areas where the fat gets collected in the most hazardous and easy way. They are-
<br>
<br>Thigh
<br>Buttocks and hips
<br>Inner knee
<br>Cheeks, chin and neck
<br>Calves and ankles
<br>Abdomen
<br>Waist
<br>Back
<br>Upper arms
<br>Chest area 
<br> Liposuction Surgery Procedure:
<br>
<br>The surgical treatment for  fat loss surgery procedure includes: 
<br>
<br>The first and foremost anaesthesia is administered to the patient before the commencement of the liposuction surgery.
<br>The surgeon makes few incisions at few areas for the treatment.
<br>To reduce bleeding and trauma a diluted local anaesthesia is injected.
<br>After the injection of local anaesthesia a thin hollow tube (cannula) will be inserted through that incision. Moving the cannula back and forth will make the excess fat a bit loose.
<br>The loosened fat (or the broken fat) will be removed using a vacuum attached to the cannula.
<br>Once this is done, the incisions will be closed by the surgeon through stitches. Proper dressings will be done on the wounds if any.
<br>Avoiding side effects can be done by following wholeheartedly the recommendations and advice of the surgeon as the case may vary from person to person. In some cases swelling may take place however it gets solved in no time.</p>
